Just the guide

Hi, there! I am new here and I have little knowledge in programming. However, I wanna be a programmer in Games. I am now a undergraduate student in China and I will go to the USA for further study in CS. I hope that I can gain more skills and experience and get a good job. At the same time, I want to finish my dream.
